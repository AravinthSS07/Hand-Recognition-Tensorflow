# Hand-Recognition-Tensorflow

## Basic Information

### This is a Machine Learning project that recognizes the hand gesture. Made using Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Keras and Mediapipe

## Modules Required
- OpenCV => ```pip install opencv-python```
- Tensorflow => ```pip install tensorflow```
- Mediapipe => ```pip install mediapipe```
- Keras (installed with tensorflow)

## How to run the program
- install the above the modules
- open the code folder and run handrecog.py
- make sure you have a camera 'cause it needs camera to see the gesture

### To kill the program simply close the python shell or command line or click on the camera preview and press the key 'Q' on your keyboard
